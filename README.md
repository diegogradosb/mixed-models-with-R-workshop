Mixed Models with R Workshop

This is the companion slides, data, and RStudio project for a workshop whose basis is the document: [Mixed Models with R](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/). A previous version can be found [here](https://github.com/m-clark/mixed-models-with-r-workshop-2019), though this will be the primary workshop repo moving forward.  Once the workshop is conducted, the slides can be seen [here](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R-workshop/).
