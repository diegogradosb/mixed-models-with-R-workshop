class: inverse 

# Additional Grouping Structure: &lt;br&gt;Cross-classified Models

Often there is additional clustering/grouping.

Example:
- Items on a test
- Everyone sees all/multiple items
- Observations clustered within person and item

Terminology: *cross-classified models*

More generic: *non-nested*

# Additional Grouping Structure: &lt;br&gt;Nested Models

Sometimes we have clusters nested within other clusters
  
- Possibly nested within still other clusters.
  
Example:
  
  - Repeated observations of people
  - Observations nested within person
  - People nested within county
  - County within state

# Additional Grouping Structure


Nested scenarios are a special case of general (non-nested) clustering


Whether factors are crossed or nested is property of the data...

*Not the model!*

Student Achievement
&gt;Achievement scores for students. The sources of dependency are due to students having gone to the same primary or secondary schools. However, in this example, going to a primary school doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll go to a specific secondary school.

# Example: Nested 

Nursing
&gt;For our demonstration we'll use the nurses data set. Here we are interested in the effect of a training program (`treatment`) on stress levels (on a scale of 1-7) of nurses.  In this scenario, nurses are nested within wards, which themselves are nested within hospitals, so we will have random effects pertaining to ward (within hospital) and hospital.

What was the difference?

--

`wardid` properly contains unique values for each ward

`ward` is just numbered `1:*` for each hospital

--

So if your labels are correct...

... you can always just used 'crossed' style. 😃

`$$\Sigma = \sigma^2

# Autocorrelation

What is our interpretation? &lt;span class="" style = "font-size: 200%"&gt;🤔&lt;/span&gt;

The estimated AR correlation is 0.844.

&lt;span class="" style = "font-size:90%"&gt;
`$$\Sigma_{ar} = \sigma^2_{ar}

# Generalized Linear Models

We can generalize (linear) mixed models

Data: speed dating

&gt;In the speed dating events, the experiment randomly assigned each participant to ten short dates (four minutes) with other participants. For each date, each person rated six attributes (attractive, sincere, intelligent, fun, ambitious, shared interests) of the other person on a 10-point scale and wrote down whether he or she would like to see the other person again. Our target variable is whether the participant would be willing to date the person again (decision).

# Exercises


##### Sociometric data

In the following data, kids are put into different groups and rate each other in terms of how much they would like to share some activity with the others. We have identifying variables for the person doing the rating (sender), the person being rated (receiver), what group they are in, as well as age and sex for both sender and receiver, as well as group size.

---
class: inverse 

# Exercises

To run a mixed model, we will have three sources of structure to consider:

- senders (within group)
- receivers (within group)
- group

First, load the sociometric data. 


```r
load('data/sociometric.RData')
```

---
class: inverse slide-title-90 slide-font-75 slide-less-pad 

# Exercises


To run the model, we will proceed with the following modeling steps. For each, make sure you are creating a separate model object for each model run.

- &lt;span style = "font-size: 75%"&gt;*Model 1*: No covariates, only sender and receiver random effects. Note that even though we don't add group yet, still use the nesting approach to specify the effects (e.g. `1|group:receiver`)&lt;/span&gt;
- &lt;span style = "font-size: 75%"&gt;*Model 2*: No covariates, add group random effect&lt;/span&gt;
- &lt;span style = "font-size: 75%"&gt;*Model 3*: Add all covariates: `agesend/rec`, `sexsend/rec`, and `grsize` (group size)&lt;/span&gt;
- &lt;span style = "font-size: 75%"&gt;*Model 4*: In order to examine sex matching effects, add an interaction of the sex variables to the model `sexsend:sexrec`.&lt;/span&gt;
- &lt;span style = "font-size: 75%"&gt;Compare models with AIC.&lt;/span&gt;
